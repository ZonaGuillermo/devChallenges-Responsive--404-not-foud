## Overview

Hello everyone!! ðŸ˜Š

This is the first challenge about Responsive Web Developer path in [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/). It consist to create a 404 error page following a given design in Figma.

In this case I have the opportunity to investigate about CSS Grid Layout and fluid design. I think fluid design is a better practice than media queries as whith a fluid design we have a lower maintenance and it adapts to all new screens today or in the future.

I have used functions like [clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp), [min()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min) and [max()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max) and also [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) and [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).

In addition, I discover a new [web tool](https://min-max-calculator.9elements.com/) that makes coding with `clamp()` more efficient

<br>

### Built With

This time I have used HTML and CSS only.

<br>
